Before I move to the city, Tom live in my hometown for a long time. I meet a lot of friends, they play together all the time. Lucy is my best friend, Candy lives next to me. I am a shy girl, but Lucy is very nice to me, later I become active. Now I miss her very much, I will go to visit her when I have vacation.
