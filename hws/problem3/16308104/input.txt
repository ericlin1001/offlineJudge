Iphone is very popular in China, especially for the young people, they chase the fashion and are very proud to have a iphone at hand. So when the newest product comes out, they are crazy about it and want to own it in the first time, so that they can show to their friends. Now iphone7 is on the market soon, many people have planned to have it. It is known to all that the price of iphone is not cheap, many teenagers don¡¯t have enough money to buy it, some of them will do the bad things to buy it, like begging their parents to buy it, or the most exaggerated thing is to sell the organ for getting enough money. I don¡¯t oppose people to chase the fashion, but they must know their limitation, or they will hurt themselves.?
