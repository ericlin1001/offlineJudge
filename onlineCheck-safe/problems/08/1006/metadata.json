The standard deviation is a statistic that tells you how tightly all the various data are clustered around the mean in a set of data.<\/p>\r\n<p>For example, what is the average age of the students in a class? How close are the ages? If all the students are the same age, the deviation is 0.<\/p>\r\n<p>Write a program that reads data set from input and computes the mean and <br \/>\r\nstandard deviations of these numbers using the following formula:<br \/>\r\nsum(n) = x1 + x2 + ... + xn<br \/>\r\nmean(n) = sum(n)\/n <br \/>\r\nsquaresum(n) = x1^2 + x2^2 + ... + xn^2<br \/>\r\ndeviation(n) = sqrt( (squaresum(n) - sum(n)*sum(n)\/n) \/ (n-1) )<\/p>","input":"<p>The first line is a positive number t (0&lt;t&lt;20).
