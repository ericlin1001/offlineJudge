The time is input as hours and minutes, separated by a space. Hours are specified in 24-hour time (15 is 3 PM), but the output should be in 12-hour AM\/PM form. Note that noon and midnight are special cases.<\/p>\r\n<p>After each time is input, the user&nbsp;enters&nbsp;&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to indicate if he or she wants to enter another time, you should repeat the process until &quot;no&quot; is entered. You should be able to code this easily using a Do-While statement.<\/p>","input":"","output":"","sample_input":"12 00\r\nyes\r\n0 00\r\nyes\r\n6 44\r\nyes\r\n18 11\r\nno","sample_output":"Noon\r\nMidnight\r\nSix forty four AM\r\nSix eleven PM","accepted":"44","submissions":"124","special_judge":"0","has_framework":"0","author":"Chapt 09","hint":"","avail":"1","cid":"1423","rate_tot":"0","rate_count":"0","dataversion":"0","stdsid":"0"}
